# Intro

Hello, I'm Mudit Mohit, a GenAI Engineer specializing in building production-ready AI systems. I graduated with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (AI Specialization) from NIIT University in 2025.

I build intelligent solutions that bridge cutting-edge AI with real-world applications—from voice AI agents that hold natural conversations to human-in-the-loop systems that learn from human feedback. My expertise spans LLM integration, voice processing, RAG architectures, and scalable Python development.

My professional journey includes experience as a Python Developer Intern at Infinx Services and as a Jr. Software Engineer (AI/ML) at Cyberbells ITES Services, where I delivered multiple AI/ML projects including health assistants, e-commerce solutions, and QA analysis tools.

Currently, I'm focused on building innovative GenAI applications that solve real problems—like my recent Human-in-the-Loop Voice Agent that achieves 100% accuracy while intelligently routing complex queries to human supervisors.

I'm passionate about creating AI systems that are reliable, scalable, and make a tangible impact.
